What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nData scientist organize, extract and analyze data with the goal of addressing specific problems or answering questions. They focus on creating systems that perform these analyses and produce useful results whereas statisticians is using mathematical and statistical models to analyze data. \nSimilarity Both collect the information and use it to perform the analysis."

For this first of all I will perform EDA, then build model and at last predict the model. And if I know the statistics then I can apply many statistical concepts like hypothesis testing, probability etc for making good decision."
